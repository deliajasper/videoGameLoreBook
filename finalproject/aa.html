Miles Edgeworth returns as a prosecutor (an undefeated one) but Pheonix defends Maya and convicts the real murderer. </p>

                     <p> After the events of the first game, Mia moves back to her home village to continue her training as a spirit medium. While training, Maya is accused of killing someone while under the influence of a spirit. Forced to defend her again, Pheonix runs into a new prosecutor, Franziska Von Karma (Manfred's Daughter). She is also the foster sister of Miles Edgeworth, Edgeworth is believed to have committed suicide. Pheonix proves her innocence. After this case, Pheonix takes Maya's cousin Pearl on as an apprentice. </p>
                     <p> Maya is then kidnapped by Shelly de Killer, who threatens to kill her if Pheonix does not get her client acquitted. De Killer stages an assassination of Franziska Von Karma, who is show and survives, but is unable to serve as prosecutor on this case. None other than Miles Edgeworth then shows up to be the prosecutor. Pheonix discovers that de Killer's client hired them to kill the person who was murdered. Pheonix then has to decide whether to convict de Killer's client at the risk of Maya's life. While Pheonix tries to prolong the trial, Edgeworth offers to help him because he has also been trying to convict de Killer. Using a tape that the client recorded as blackmail, Pheonix proves to de Killer that their client was going to blackmail them. The client pleads guilty, Maya is released.</p>
                     <p> Edgeworth reveals that his absense was an attempt to find the "answer" to what it means to be a prosecutor, and he and Pheonix reconcile. Franziska pledges to renounce her position, but Edgeworth confronts her and she recognizes she has to find the same answer he did, so she returns to Germany. </p>

                  </summary>
                  <div>
                     <p> This game starts with a flashback to when Pheonix was dating Dahlia and he gets accused of her ex's murder. </p>
                     <p> The next flashback case depicts Mia's first case where she is defending an inmate accused of killing policewoman Valerie Hawthorne. The prosecutor in this case is Edgeworth, it being his first case. Mia eventually learns the truth that Dahlia had killed Valerie. </p>
                     <p> In the last case, Pheonix is visiting a resort with Maya and Pearl when a guest is murdered. While looking for Maya, Pheonix falls into a river and contracts pneumonia. This forces Edgeworth to fill in as the defense attorney, facing off against Franziska Von Karma to keep his client, Iris, from getting convicted. When Pheonix returns, he explains that he found out that the murder victim was really Maya's long-lost mother Misty Fey. Her death was the result of a plan from her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the newly-executed Dahlia who is Iris's twin. Pheonix then learns during the trial that not only was Dahlia impersonating Iris, but she was using Maya's body to do so. Dahlia is then exorcised from Maya and the real Iris is declared innocent. </p>

                     <p> Apollo and his mentor Kristoph Gavin are called to represent Pheonix Wright after he is accused of murdering someone over a rigged game of poker. During the trial, Pheonix names Kristoph as a witness, and Apollo is able to prove that he is the real murderer. Pheonix offers to help Apollo start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency (The Wright Anything Agency). </p>
                     <p> Seven years earlier, Pheonix was tricked into using false evidence while representing his client Zak Gramarye which cost him his reputation and job. Zak then disappeared, leaving Trucy in Pheonix's care. Throughout his disbarred years, Pheonix uncovers the truth that Apollo and Trucy are half-siblings gifted with the power of perception.</p>
                     <p> During the trial for a case in which Apollo's client Vera is accused of poisoning her father, Kristoph is summoned to testify. He reveals that he had been Zak's original attorney before Pheonix but was fired. Kristoph was the one who had requested the creation of the fake evidence. Apollo then accuses him of setting up Phoenix with the false evidence before attempting to kill everyone related to the case out of fear of being found out.</p>
                     <p> Vera is found not guilty, and with his name cleared Pheonix applies for readmission to the bar.</p>

Blackquill's sister Aura takes several people hostage, including Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy, demanding that a re-trial of the case be held to convict Athena for Metis's murder. Together with chief prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix deduces that a third party was responsible for the murder, proving Athena's and Blackquill's innocence. </p>

She is proven innocent. </p>
                     <p> After many trials, the current queen of Khura'in is dethroned after it is proven that she has no claim to the throne.
