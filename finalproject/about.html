            <h4> About Me </h4>
            <p> Hi! I am Delia Jasper and I am a high schooler (hopeful CS major) from Massachussetts. This is my website about some of my favorite video games and their lore. I noticed that a lot of the wikis on these games are either confusing or hard to read, and many people just want a quick recap before they start playing. So, I made The Videogame Lorebook.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I have been playing videogames since I was very young (my first real one being Minecraft). They are a big hobby of mine and I hope to become a video game developer as a career. I am working on some games right now, but nothing complete yet. </p>
            <br>
            <p> My other hobbies include reading and crochet. I also like to write and I do a lot of theatre both with my school and outside of it. I am also the founder of my school's robotics team (FTC) and am very involved with mentoring.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Welcome to my website and I hope you enjoy! Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions/comments/concerns on the Contact page! </p>
