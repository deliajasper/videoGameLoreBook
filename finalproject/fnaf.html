            <p> The Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) lore is one of the most complicated in recent history. </p>
            <br>
            <h4> Lore TLDR: </h4>
            <p> This guy named William Afton kills kids, they possess animatronic suits and then his son Michael goes on a quest to release their souls </p>
            <div>

               <h2 class = "fnafheading"> Lore Overview </h2>
               <br>
               <p> There are many different interpretations of this lore, the one the author is basing this retelling off of is Game Theory's theories about the lore. Click <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHf0nQmXTTZuhbWtt3rYJ-eQw93rXIY1N"> here</a> to see a playlist of all of their theories about FNAF. </p>
               <br>
               <p> It all starts with two friends, William Afton and  Henry Emily. They are the owners and co-founders of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. William has 3 children: Michael, Elizabeth, and Evan. Herny only has one: Charlotte (Charlie). They also both have wives.</p>

                     The First Location / Charlie's Death
                  </summary>
                  <div>
                     <p> The first pizza restaurant ever opened was Fredbear's Family Diner. This location was extremely popular. There were only two animatronics, Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. These animatronics are springlock animatronics, this means they also double as suits for employees to wear. However, these suits are very dangerous and lock up with any moisture, killing the wearer. At this location, in order to protect his daughter, Henry created the marionette animatronic. However, one day the puppet malfunctioned and it got stuck. That day, Charlie (Henry's Daughter) was killed by William Afton. The puppet then finds Charlie's body, then Charlie's spirit possesses the puppet. This is William's first murder.</p>
                     <p> After Charlie's death, Fredbear's Family Diner was sold to new owners, a new location is then opened: Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. This is the location seen in FNAF 2. </p>

                  <div>
                     <p> Soon after Charlie's death, the Bite of '83 takes place. This is when Evan Afton is forcibly put in the mouth of a springlock animatronic while crying, causing it to lock up, crushing his head and killing him. This finally causes Fredbear's Family Diner to close. </p>

                     The Missing Children's Incident
                  </summary>
                  <div>
                     <p> In the new location, The Missing Children's Incident occurs. This is when William Afton in the Spring Bonnie suit, lures 5 children into the back of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. He then kills them. He stuffs their bodies into 4 work in progress suits: Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. He then puts the last child into the old Fredbear suit. These children's spirits then go on to possess the suits they are stuffed into. </p>
                     <p> The Victims of the Missing Children's Incident</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li> Gabriel - Freddy </li>
                        <li> Jeremy - Bonnie </li>
                        <li> Susie - Chica (The first to die) </li>
                        <li> Fritz - Foxy </li>
                        <li> Cassidy - Fredbear </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p> Cassidy later becomes known as "Golden Freddy". Golden Freddy has two spirits inside of him: Cassidy (the Missing Children's Incident victim) and Evan Afton (William's son who was killed in the Bite of '83).</p>

                     <p> After the Missing Children’s Incident, Afton built a new animatronic, Circus Baby. She was built to capture and kill children. He opens a new location (a sister location) Circus Baby’s Pizza World. Elizabeth Afton, William's Daughter, was killed by Circus Baby after being lured by ice cream. This causes Circus Baby’s to close on its opening day </p>
                     <p> After the closing of Circus Baby’s Pizza world William went forward with the rental service. The animatronics were put into storage, but were available to the public to rent out. This turns into the warehouse that Sister Location takes place in </p>

                  <div>
                     <p> In 1987, they reopen a Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza with new and improved animatronics. This is the FNAF 2 location, FNAF 2 is a prequel. The toy animatronics are very secure, they have an advanced facial recognition system </p>
                     <p> In this new location William kills 5 more kids them going on to possess the Toy Animatronics, Mangle, and Balloon Boy(?). We do not know the identities of these kids as this is not 100% cannon, but most theorists are sure that William killed 5 more kids </p>
                     <p> This is the famed “Bite of ‘87” that Phone Guy in FNAF 1 talks about. After the Second Missing Children’s Incident the Toy Animatronics become more aggressive towards adults. The animatronics end up attacking the daytime security guard, biting off his frontal lobe. </p>
                     <p>After the Bite of ‘87 the FNAF 2 location shuts down. A few years later in 1993 they open a new location, the FNAF 1 location. They have the original Work in Progress animatronics possessed by the kids killed in the first Missing Children’s Incident. No one comes, then it shuts down. </p>

There, he discovers that his sister is inhabiting the animatronic Baby and that his father killed a bunch of kids. He then is determined to set the souls of the kids free </p>
                     <p> Michael, while working at the Sister Location location gets “scooped”. This means he gets his insides ripped out of him because this machine is used to rip remnant out of animatronics. He gets used as a skin suit by Enard, who is an amalgamation of all of the Sister Location animatronics </p>

                     <p>Michael then gets a job at Fazbear Frights. At the end of FNAF 3 Michael tries to kill his dad once and for all by burning Fazbear Frights to the ground. However, this again does not kill William </p>

            <br>
            <p> I love the FNAF franchise. I have been playing the games since the first one came out when i was 9 and been theorizing with MatPat (Game Theory) just as long. My favorite game is probably FNAF 6 (Pizzeria Simulator). Mostly because of <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Q_e6hxyyA"> Henry's Monologue</a> at the end. It is. So good. </p>
